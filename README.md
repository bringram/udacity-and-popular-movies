This app was developed as part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program.

## Including Your API Key

As this app relies on a 3rd party API, you will need to generate your own API Key if you do not have one. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to [create one](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) in order to request an API Key.

Once you've signed up for TheMovieDB and generated your key, please copy `example-gradle.properties` into a new file called `gradle.properties`. Once the file is created, open the file and scroll to the bottom and place your API key in the defined field. Make sure your key is still surrounded with the quotes.

```bash
API_KEY="{YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}"
```
